# loan-classification
For this project I took data from the [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/) and  used a logistic regression model to  predict whether an applicant would default on a particular loan. This type of model is useful in the 'real' world and is beneficial to both parties. For the applicant, they preserve their credit history. For the lender, they are able to not lose money.
